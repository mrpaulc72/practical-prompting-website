# Executive Summary: Practical Prompting Homepage

**Project:** Practical Prompting Homepage Redesign  
**Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Prepared for:** Stakeholders & Decision Makers  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Launch

---

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

### The Problem We're Solving
The previous homepage suffered from a **"strategic fracture"** — it lacked focus and failed to validate the core frustration of our target audience: inconsistent AI results that waste time and money.

### Our Solution
A laser-focused, single-purpose homepage that acts as a **"magnifying glass"** for the brand. Every element is designed to:
1. **Validate** the visitor's frustration with AI
2. **Present** a systematic solution (the CLO Framework)
3. **Convert** visitors to the primary sales page

---

## 👥 Target Audience

### "Solo Creator Sam"
- **Profile:** Established service providers (consultants, coaches, agencies)
- **Revenue:** $100k-$250k annually
- **Behavior:** Uses AI (ChatGPT, Claude) daily
- **Pain Point:** Gets inconsistent, low-quality results (~30% success rate)
- **Mindset:** Skeptical of "gurus" and hype; needs proven, systematic solutions

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary Metric
**Click-Through Rate (CTR) on "FIX MY PROMPTS" CTA**
- Target: >15% of visitors click through to `/sales`

### Secondary Metrics
- **Bounce Rate:** <40% (industry standard: 40-60%)
- **Time on Page:** >2 minutes
- **Scroll Depth:** >75% scroll past hero
- **Mobile Traffic:** Optimized for 60%+ mobile users

---

## 🎨 Brand Positioning: "The AI Realist"

### Voice & Tone
- **Honest & Grounded:** No hype, no false promises
- **Expert but Relatable:** "Fellow traveler" approach
- **Proof-Oriented:** "Tested 50 times," real examples
- **Anti-Guru:** Systematic methodology over magic tricks

### Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor Approach | Our Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "Prompt packs" and templates | Systematic framework (CLO) |
| "Magic prompts" and hacks | Root cause analysis of failures |
| Generic AI courses | Industry-specific voice calibration |
| Hype and exaggeration | Honest about what AI sucks at |
